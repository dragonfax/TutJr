### Status

Playable.

### How To Play

You must navigate your hero to the exit (big E). Avoid the monsters along the way. You'll need to grab the key to unlock the gate in front of the exit.

There are turnstyle rotating doors that you can rotate by pushing against them. These doors also block the monsters path.
